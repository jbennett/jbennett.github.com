* Sarnia Gives - July 2011
	Sarnia Gives is a website which allows volunteers to easily be connected to non-profit organizations in the Sarnia-Lambton area. It uses Joomla! as a base CMS and a custom built extension to allow users to easily register as organizations and volunteers, as well as easier search volunteer opportunities based on criteria and location.
* ND Today - Ongoing
	ND Today is a social website for the University of Notre Dame. Created in 2001, it has been revamped three times with a fourth in progress. This redevelopment is being done to help establish a stable foundation which can be used for years to come as new functionality is needed.
